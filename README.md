# Smart-Irrigation-System-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
A computer networks project developed to control irrigation systems in an efficient manner smartly using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT).
This project is simulated and configured to run in CPT. It uses the networking functionalities provided by CPT to be able to simulate in near real world scenario. The entire network is configured either using GUI or CLI in CPT.
Our project brings out the latency differences in various configurations of Smart Irrigation Network - WSN based as well as IoT based. Also, the various shortcomings of such network connections are also described.
To overcome this issue, we have proposed to use multiple gateways to reduce latency and RTT in the Irrigation Network to increase the efficiency of the system.
